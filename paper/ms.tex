\begin{abstract}
We use bootstrapping to estimate the bias of concentration
estimates on N-body dark matter halos as a function of particle
number. 
We find that algorithms based on the maximum radial velocity
and radial particle binning tend to overestimate the concentration by 
$15\%-20\%$ for halos sampled with $200$ particles and by $7\%$-$10\%$
for halos sampled with $500$ particles. 
To control this bias at low particle numbers we propose a new
algorithm to estimate halo concentrations based on the integrated mass
profile.   
The method uses the full particle information without any binning,
making it reliable in cases when low numerical resolution becomes a
limitation for other methods.
This method reduces the bias to $1\%-3\%$ for halos sampled with
$200$-$500$ particles.
The velocity and density methods have to use halos with least $\sim
4000$ particles in order to keep the biases down to the same low
level. 
We also show that the mass-concentration relationship could be
shallower than expected from numerical experiments once the biases 
of the different concentration measurements are taken into account.
These results show that bootstrapping and the
concentration estimates based on the integrated mass profile are
valuable tools to probe the internal structure of dark matter halos
in numerical simulations.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%*************************************************************************
In the current structure formation paradigm the properties of galaxies
are coupled to the evolution of their dark matter (DM) hosting halo.
In this paradigm the sizes and dynamics of galaxies are driven by
the DM distribution inside a halo. This has motivated the detailed study
a DM halo internal structure in the last three decades. 

The internal DM distribution in a halo is usually parameterized
through the density profile.  In a first approximation this profile is
spherically symmetric; the density only depends on the radial
coordinate.  One of the most popular radial parameterizations is
the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile \citep{NFW}.  
This profile can be considered as universal \citep{Navarro2010}, assuming that 
one is not interested in the very central region of the dark matter halo where
galaxy formation takes place, and where the effects of baryon physics
on dark matter distribution are still unknown.
This profile is a double power law in radius, where the transition
break happens at the so-called scale radius, $r_s$.  The ratio between
the scale radius and the halo virial radius $R_v$ is known as the
concentration $c=R_v/r_s$.


The concentration of the NFW profile provides a conceptual framework
to study simulated dark matter halos as a function of redshift and
cosmological parameters.  In many numerical studies
\citep{Neto2007,Maccio2008,Duffy2008,Munoz2011,Prada2012,Ludlow2014}
the results are summarized through the mass-concentration
relationship; that is the distribution of concentration values at a
fixed halo mass and redshift.  The success of such numerical
experiments rests on a reliable algorithm to estimate the
concentration.  Such an algorithm should provide unbiased results and
must be robust when applied to simulations of different numerical
resolution.

There are two established algorithms to estimate the concentration
parameter of a N-body dark matter halo.  The first method takes the
halo particles and bins them into logarithmic radii to estimate the
density in each bin, then it proceeds to fit the density as a function
of the radius to the NFW profile.  A second method uses an analytic
property of the NFW profile that relates the maximum of the ratio of
the circular velocity to the virial velocity, $V_{\rm circ}$/$V_{\rm
  vir}$.  The concentration can be then found as the root of an
algebraic equation dependent on this maximum value.

The first method is straightforward to apply but presents two
disadvantages.  First, it requires a large number of particles in
order to have a proper density estimate in each bin.  This makes the
method robust only for halos with at least $10^2$ particles.  The
second problem is that there is not a way to estimate the optimal
radial bin size, different choices may produce different results for
the concentration.

The second method solves the two problems mentioned above.  
It works with low particle numbers and does not involve data binning.  
However,
it effectively takes into account only a single data point and
discards the behavior of the ratio $V_{\rm circ}/V_{\rm vir}$ below
and above its maxima.  
Small fluctuations on the value of this maximum
can yield large perturbations on the estimated concentration
parameter.

In this letter we use bootstrapping to estimate the bias and standard
deviation on the concentration estimates as a function of particle
number. 
We show that the two standard methods to estimate concentrations have
increasing biases for decreasing particle numbers.  


This motivates us to present a third alternative based on fitting the
integrated mass profile.  
This approach has two advantages with respect to the above mentioned methods.  
It does not involve any data binning and does not throw away data points.  
This translates into a robust estimate even at low resolution/particle numbers.  
Furthermore, since the method does not require any binning, there is no need to
tune numerical parameters.   
This method provides a new independent method to estimate the
concentration parameter.   






\section{Basic properties of the NFW density profile}
\label{sec:basics}

Let us review first the basic properties of the NFW density profile.
This shall help us to define our notation.

\subsection{Density profile}

The NFW density profile can be written as

\begin{equation}
\rho(r) = \frac{\rho_c\delta_c}{r/r_s(1+r/r_s)^2},
\label{eq:definition}
\end{equation}
%
where $\rho_c\equiv 3H^2/8\pi G$ is the Universe critical density, $H$
is the Hubble constant, $G$ and the universal gravitational constant,
$\delta_c$ is the halo dimensionless characteristic density and $r_s$
is the scale radius.  This radius marks the point where the
logarithmic slope of the density profile is equal to -2, the
transition between the power law scaling $\rho\propto r^{-1}$ for
$r<r_s$ and $\rho\propto r^{-3}$ for $r>r_s$.

We define the virial radius of a halo, $r_v$, as the boundary of the
spherical volume that encloses a density of $\Delta_h$ times the mean
density of the Universe.  The corresponding mass $M_{v}$, the virial
mass, can be written as $M_{v} = \frac{4\pi}{3}\bar{\rho}\Delta_h
r_v^3$.  From these virial quantities we define new dimensionless
variables for the radius and mass $x\equiv r/r_v$ and $m\equiv
M(<r)/M_v$.

In this letter we use $\Delta_h=740$, a number roughly corresponding to
200 times the critical density at redshift z=0.


\subsection{Integrated mass profile}

From these definitions we can compute the total mass enclosed inside a
radius $r$:
\begin{equation}
M(<r) = 4\pi\rho_c\delta_c  r_s^3\left[\ln \left
  (\frac{r_s+r}{r_s}\right) - \frac{r}{r_s+r}\right],
\end{equation}
%
or in terms of the dimensionless mass and radius variables

\begin{equation}
m(<x) =
\frac{1}{A}\left[\ln\left(1+xc\right)-\left(\frac{xc}{xc+1}\right)\right],
\label{eq:profile}
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
A=\ln\left(1+c\right)-\left(\frac{c}{c+1}\right),
\end{equation}
%
and the parameter $c$ corresponds to the concentration $c\equiv
r_v/r_s$.

From this normalization and for later convenience we define the
following function
%
\begin{equation}
f(x) = \ln\left(1+x\right)-\left(\frac{x}{x+1}\right).
\label{eq:f_NFW}
\end{equation}
%
The most interesting feature of Eq. (\ref{eq:profile}) is that the
concentration is the only free parameter to describe the integrated
mass profile.
 
\subsection{Circular velocity profile}

It is also customary to express the mass of the halo in terms of the
circular velocity $V_{c}=\sqrt{GM(<r)/r}$.  From this we can define a
new dimensionless circular velocity $v(<x)\equiv
V_{c}(<r)/V_{c}(<r_v)$, using the result in Eq. \ref{eq:profile} we
have:

\begin{equation}
v(<x)=\sqrt{\frac{1}{A}\left[\frac{\ln\left(1+xc\right)}{x}-\frac{c}{xc+1}\right]},
\end{equation}
%
This normalized profile always shows a maximum provided that the
concentration is larger than $c>2$.  It is possible to show that for
the NFW profile the maximum is provided by

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{max}(v(<x)) = \sqrt{\frac{c}{x_{\rm max}}\frac{f(x_{\rm
      max})}{f(c)}},
\label{eq:max_v}
\end{equation}
where $x_{\rm max}=2.163$ \citep{Klypin2016} and the function $f(x)$
corresponds to the definition in Eq. (\ref{eq:f_NFW}).

  halo population) the $1\sigma$ is of the same order with a
  decreasing behavior as $1/\sqrt{N_s}$.

\section{Methods to estimate the concentration from N-body simulations}
\label{sec:method}

\subsection{Estimates from the density and velocity profiles}

To date, there are two standard methods to estimate concentrations in
dark matter halos extracted from N-body simulations.  The first method
tries to directly estimate the density profile.  It takes all the
particles in the halo and bins them in the logarithm of the radial
coordinate from the halo center.  Then, it estimates the density in
each logarithmic bin counting the particles and dividing by the
corresponding shell volume.  At this point is possible to make a
direct fit to the density as a function of the radial coordinate.
This method has been broadly used for more than two decades to study
the mass-concentration-redshift relation of dark matter halos.
 
A second method uses the circular velocity profile.  It finds the
value of $x$ for which the normalized circular velocity $v(<x)$ shows
a maximum.  Using this value it solves numerically for the
corresponding value of the concentration using Eq. (\ref{eq:max_v}).
This method has been most recently used by \cite{Klypin2016} to study
the mass-concentration-redshift relation using the Multidark
Simulation Suite.


\subsection{Our proposal: estimate from the integrated mass profile}

Here we propose a new method to estimate the concentration. 
It uses the integrated mass profile defined in
Eq. (\ref{eq:profile}).  We build it from N-body data following the
next steps.  First, we define the center of the halo to be at the
position of the particle with the lowest gravitational potential.
Then we rank the particles by their increasing radial distance from
the center.  From this ranked list of $i=1,N$ particles, the total
mass at a radius $r_i$ is $M_i=i\times m_p$, where $r_i$ is the
position of the $i$-th particle and $m_p$ is the mass of a single
computational particle.

We divide the enclosed mass mass $M_i$ and the radii $r_i$ by their
virial values to obtain the dimensionless variables $m_i$ and $x_i$.
Once the mass profile is expressed in dimensionless variables the
concentration is the only free parameter.  
We then use an Affine Invariant Markov Chain Monte Carlo implemented
in the python module {\texttt{emcee}} \citep{emcee} to sample the
likelihood function distribution defined by ${\cal L}(c)\propto
\exp(-\chi^2(c)/2)$ where the $\chi^2(c)$ is written as 

\begin{equation}
\chi^2(c)= \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}[\log m_i - \log m(< x_i;c)]^2,
\end{equation}
%
where $m(<x_i;c)$ corresponds to the values in Eq.(\ref{eq:profile})
at $x=x_i$ for a given value of the concentration parameter $c$ and
the $i$ index sums over all the particles in the numerical profile.
From the $\chi^2$ distribution we find the optimal value of the
concentration and its associated uncertainty.


\section{Numerical Simulations and Halo Samples}

We use two very different simulations to be sure that the results (bias,
uncertainty on the bias) measured using bootstrapping tests are
independent of the kind of parent simulation.

We use data from the Bolshoi cosmological simulation that follows the
non-linear evolution of a dark matter density field sampled with
$2048^3$ particles over a cubic box of $250\ \hMpc$ on a side.  
The cosmological parameters use a Hubble parameter $h=0.73$, a matter density
$\Omega_m=0.3071$ and a normalization of the power spectrum
$\sigma_8=0.82$. 
The data is publicly available at \url{http://www.cosmosim.org/}.  
Details about the structure of the database and the simulation can be
found in \citep{2013AN....334..691R}.

We use a halo sample containing all the halos located in a cubic
sub-volume of $100$ \hMpc\ on a side.  
From this sample we select all the halos at $z=0$ detected with a
Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm with more than 300 particles,
meaning that the masses are in the interval $4\times 10^{10}\leq
M_{\rm FoF}/\hMsun \leq 10^{14}$.  The FoF algorithm used a linking
length of $0.17$ times the mean inter-particle distance. 
This choice translates into an overdensity $\Delta_h\sim 400-700$
dependent on the halo concentration \citep{More2011}.  

From this set of particles we follow the procedure spelled out in
Section \ref{sec:method} with $\Delta_h=740$ (corresponding to $200$
times the critical density) to select an spherical region that we
redefine to be our halo.  
This choice makes that the overdensities are fully included inside the
original FoF particle group.   
On the interest of providing a fair comparison against the density
method we only report results from overdensities with at least $200$
particles ($2.6\times 10^{10}$\hMsun). 

We also use public data from the Via Lactea simulation project
\citep{2008Natur.454..735D}.  
This simulation was run for a single isolated halo with a virial mass
of the order of $10^{12}$\hMsun using the parallel tree code PKDGRAV
\citep{2001PhDT........21S}.  
The simulation used $\sim 2\times 10^{8}$ particles to resolve this
region.
The cosmological parameters are different from those in the Bolshoi
simulation, with a Hubble parameter $h=0.73$, a matter density
$\Omega_m=0.238$ and a normalization of the power spectrum
$\sigma_8=0.74$. 
The data available to the public corresponds to a downsampled set 
of $10^5$ particles which corresponds to a particle mass of
$2.24\times 10^{7}$\hMsun.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Bootstrapping to estimate biases}
\label{sec:bootstrapping}

In our bootstrapping experiments we take halos sampled with at least
$10^{5}$ particles and subsample each halo by factors of $2$ up to
$10^{3}$ to measure the concentration every time the halo is
resampled. 
Every time we keep fixed the virial radius and the center found for
the high resolution halo.
We tested that leaving the virial radius and center free in each
bootstrapping iteration has an effect lower than $1\%$ in the
concentration. 
We extract in total 10000 bootstrapping samples for the Bolshoi
and the Via Lactea simulations.
In the case of the Bolshoi simulation we select 14 massive halos and
create 700 subsamples for each halo. 
For the Via Lactea simulation only one halo is subsampled 10000
times. 

The average concentration value for the largest number of particles,
$c_{N_{max}}$, provides with a baseline to compare all the other
results.  
We use the following statistic
\begin{equation}
f_{\rm off} = c_{N} / c_{N_{max}} - 1,
\label{eq:f_off}
\end{equation}
to account for the offset between the concentration at a given
downsampled particle number $c_{N}$ and the baseline $c_{N_{max}}$.
For each method we keep its corresponding concentration $c_{N_{max}}$
value at high resolution. 


Figure \ref{fig:downsampling} summarizes our results.  
The plot on the left shows the average value of $f_{\rm off}$ as a
function of the particle number.  
As expected, for large enough sample particle numbers,
$N_{s}>4\times 10^3$, the results of the three algorithms coincide
below the $1\%$ level.
For a lower number of particles, the results deviate from the expected
concentration value.  
For $200$ particles the velocity method overestimates by a factor
$14\%$ while the density method overestimates it by $20\%$.
Around the same sampling scale, the new algorithm shows a more stable
behaviour underestimating the concentration only by a factor of
$1\%$-$2\%$


The line on the same panel shows a fit to the data with the following
functional form 
\begin{equation}
f_{\rm off} = \frac{A}{(1+\log_{10}N_s)^{B}}.
\label{eq:f_off_fit}
\end{equation} 
for the dataset shown in the panel we have $A=2842\pm 1900$,
$B=7.96\pm 0.54$ for the density method; $A=239\pm 131$,
$B=6.23\pm 0.43$ for the velocity method; $A=-3.66\pm 5.22$,
$B=4.65\pm 1.12$ for the integrated mass method.
The uncertainties are estimated from the covariance  matrix resulting
from the non-linear optimization procedure. The lines on Figure
\ref{fig:downsampling} are plotted using these best values.  


The right panel in \ref{fig:downsampling} shows different uncertainty
results. 
The lines show the difference between the 14 and 86 percentiles in the
$f_{\rm off}$ distribution at fixed mass.
Each line corresponds to the three different methods to estimate the
concentration and the two simulations.
This shows that the bootstrapping technique can help us to assign a
$1\sigma$ uncertainty to the concentration values at a fixed $N_s$. 
This uncertainty is shown as normalized by the preferred value of the
concentration, which in this case corresponds to $c_{N_{max}}$.  
The circles in the same figure show the $1\sigma$ uncertainty as
estimated from the MCMC chains using the integrated mass method on all
the relaxed halos in the Bolshoi simulation sample. 
To allow for a fair comparison with the bootstrapping results, this
uncertainty was normalized by the preferred concentration.
The MCMC uncertainties follow the same trend as the bootstrapping
results. 

From these results we defined a universal $1\sigma$ fractional
uncertainty for the concentration as a function of the number of
particles $N_s$ as  
%
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{c} = \frac{0.40}{\sqrt{N_s/200}}.
\end{equation}
%
An interesting consequence of this result is that $\sigma_c=1$ for
$N_s=32$ particles, independent of the method used to estimate the
concentration.  

 
\subsection{Impact on the Mass-Concentration Relationship}

We now compare the results for the mass-concentration
relationship obtained with the three different algorithms.
This helps to compare the concentration results
of the new algorithm and, more importantly, showcase a probable
consequence of the biases detected through bootstrapping. 


Figure \ref{fig:concentration} shows the mass-concentration
relationship for the density, velocity and integrated mass method.
The left panel shows the results as they are produced by each of the
algorithms, the thin dashed line marks the results by
\citep{Prada2012}.

We notice first that the results from the new algorithm follow very
closely the velocity algorithm at high masses ($M_h>10^{12}\hMsun$ or
equivalently for $>8\times10^3$ particles). 
For lower masses there is a difference between the median of the two
methods, but they are still consistent within the statistical
uncertainties.

We also notice that the results from the density method have a
systematic $15\%$ offset from the velocity methods.  
This offset was already presented by \cite{Prada2012} for low
concentrations ($c<6$) and high ($M_h>10^{12}\hMsun$) halo masses.  
Recently \citep{Klypin2016} summarized results for the
mass-concentration relationship coming from different methods and
datasets to show that similar systematic offsets are present.
\citep{2014MNRAS.441.3359D} studied the mass-concentration
relationship using the maximum velocity and density methods and did
not report any significant difference. 
However, they implemented a modified version of the velocity algorithm
that uses the data binning obtained for the density algorithm.  


We hypothesize that the increase in the results for the velocity
and density methods below $8\times 10^{3}$ particles come from the
systematic bias described in the previous section.  
To test the general consistency of this hypothesis we correct the
concentration values in the velocity and integrated mass methods by a
factor of $1/(1+f_{\rm  off})$, using the definition in Equation
(\ref{eq:f_off}) and the  
parameters obtained from the data presented in Figure
(\ref{fig:downsampling}).  
The correction brings into perfect agreement the results between the
velocity/density methods and the new algorithm.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this letter we used bootstrapping to quantify the biases on
concentration estimates. 
We found that methods commonly used in the literature present a large
bias by overestimating concentrations by factors of $15\%$-$20\%$ for
halos with $200$ particles, or $7\%$-$10\%$ for halos with $500$
particles.  
This procedure provides a robust technique to quantify the bias in
concentration estimates with the advantage that it works without
having to run new simulations. 

These results motivated us to introduce a method with a robust
performance at low particle numbers.
This method is based on the integrated mass profile. 
The results of the algorithm on the same data sample showed a bias  of
$2\%-3\%$ for halos with $200$ particles and less than $1\%$ for halos
with $500$ particles or more.  
To keep the bias of the velocity and density methods below $2\%$ only halos
with at least $\sim 4000$ particles should be taken into account.

Measuring the mass concentration relationship the three methods are in
broad agreement within the statistical  uncertainties, although there
are some noticeable differences. 
For instance, the density method produces systematically higher
concentrations by a factor of $15\%$ compared to the velocity method.
This systematic offset has been reported before with the same dataset 
\citep{Prada2012} and with different simulations \citep{Klypin2016}
without any conclusive explanation for its origin. 
A second difference is that the velocity and integrated mass methods
start to differ for masses below $10^{12}\hMsun$ ($\sim 4000$
particles).   
We found that correcting the mean concentration by the mean bias
factor found through bootstrapping brings these two techniques into
agreement. 

These results show that using the integrated mass profile to find the
Dark Matter halo concentration is a tool deserving deeper scrutiny.   
Further tests with larger simulated volumes, varying numerical
resolution and different density profiles are the next natural step to
explore the full potential of this new method.
