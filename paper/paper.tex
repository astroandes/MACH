\begin{abstract}

We present a new method to estimate the concentration of dark matter
halos in N-body simulations.  Our method finds the concentration value
to match {\bf the} integrated mass profile as a function of halo
radius.  The main advantage of this method is that it uses the full
particle information without any binning, {\bf which makes it very
  switable in cases when resolution becomes important}. We test our
method both on mock and N-body halos to compare it against two popular
methods to find concentrations: maximum radial velocity measurements
and radial particle binning to {\bf fit the density profile}. Tests on
the mock halos show that the accuracy of our method to recover input
concentrations varies with the halo {\bf resolution}. For halos
sampled with $20$ particles our method recovers the input
concentration with $10\%$ accuracy. {\bf For the maximum radial
  velocity method it is on the order of $20\%$ while density profile
  methods perform worst at the low resolution limit since they require
  at least 200 particles inside the virial radius to make a reliable
  estimate of the density profile}. For halos with $2\times 10^4$
particles our method achieves an accuracy of $0.01\%$ while the
velocity and density profile methods achieve $0.1\%$ and $1\%$,
respectively. We measure the mass-concentration relationship on N-body
data taking care of using halos sampled with at least $200$
particles. We find that at low masses $10^{12}\hMsun <
M<10^{13}\hMsun$ our method yields median concentration values lower
by a $15\%-20\%$ compared to the velocity and density methods ({\bf
  why?}).  At higher masses $3\times 10^{13}\hMsun < M < 2\times
10^{14}\hMsun$ the three methods give similar results.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%*************************************************************************
In the concordance cosmological paradigm the matter content of the
Universe is dominated by dark matter, a collisionless fluid shaped by
gravitational interactions.  In the last three decades simulations of
dark matter dominated universes have provided valuable insights into
the large scale structure formation process, showing a remarkable
success in the comparison between theoretical results and observations
of the galaxy distribution obtained from surveys.
\citep{Springel2005,2011ApJ...740..102K}.

{\bf Navarro et.al. 2010 have used high resolution simulations to show
  that the full halo density profile is not universal and follows an
  Einasto density distribution. However, if one is not interested in
  the very central region of the dark matter halo (where galaxy
  formation takes place, and where the effects of baryon physics on
  dark matter distribution is still an uncknown), one can assume an
  approximation where dark matter overdensities closely follow an
  universal density profile. In a first approximation this profile is
  spherically symmetric and its density only dependens on the radial
  coordinate. Although it is well known that the characteristics of
  this densty profile depends on redshift (Maccio et.al. 2008), its
  universal shape seems to be independent of the cosmological
  parameters and is self-similar for different spatial scales after an
  adequate re-scaling is applied. \citep{NFW,Taylor2001}
}

{\bf In such circumstances}, one the most popular parameterizations
for dark matter halo radial density distribution is the
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile \citep{NFW}.  This profile is a
double power law in radius, where the transition break happens at the
so-called scale radius, $r_s$.  The ratio between the scale radius and
the virial radius $R_v$ is known as the concentration $c=R_v/r_s$.
Simulations show that the concentration is a strong function of halo
mass and redshift and provides information about the mass assembly of
the dark matter halo (Citar paper que reproduce mis graficas y conecta
C con m(z)).

Observationally, the relationship between halo mass and concentration
could provide a potential test of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm
on galactic scales.  For this motivation a great deal of effort has
been invested in calibrating this relationship with simulations
\citep{Neto2007,Duffy2008,Munoz2011,Prada2012,Ludlow2014} and finding
the best possible way to constraint it with observations
\citep{Buote2007,Comerford2007,Mandelbaum2008,Giocoli2014,Foex2014,Shan2015}.

In N-body simulations there are two main methods to estimate the
concentration parameter of a dark matter halo in a N-body simulation.
The first method takes the particles composing the halos and bins them
in logarithmic radii to estimate the density in each bin, then it
proceeds to fit the density as a function of the radius to the NFW
profile.  A second method uses an analytic property of the NFW profile
that relates the maximum of the ratio of the circular velocity to the
virial velocity.  The concentration can be then found as the root of a
algebraic equation dependent on this maximum value.

The first method is straightforward to apply but presents two
disadvantages.  First, it requires a large number of particles in
order to have a proper density estimate in each bin.  This makes the
method robust only for halos with at least $10^3$ particles.  The
second problem is that there is not a way to estimate the optimal
radial bin size, different choices produce different results for the
concentration.

The second method solves the two problems mentioned above.  It works
with low particle numbers and does not involve data binning.  However,
it effectively takes into account only a single data point and
discards the behaviour of the ratio $V_{\rm circ}/V_{\rm vir}$ below
and above its maxima.  Additionally, small fluctuations on the value
of this maximum can yield large perturbations on the estimated
concentration parameter.

In this paper we propose a new method to estimate the dark matter halo
concentration in halos from N-body simulations.  Our method builds the
cumulative mass profile from the particle to find the best possible
concentration value fitting this distribution.  This proposal has two
advantages with respect to the two methods mentioned above.  It does
not involve any data binning and does not throw away data points {\bf
  resulting in a robust estimate even at low resolution/particle
  numbers. In the same sence, since the method does not require any
  binning, there is no need to tune numerical parameters, which
  provide definitive/independent estimates for the concentration
  parameter.}.


{\it mi opinión es que el método es muy bueno, y sobresalta sobre los
  otros dos en sus ventaja: robusto, no requiere bineo, aplica bien en
  resoluciones pobres. Como herramienta (que es lo que se está
  vendiendo en el trabajo, un método, eso es lo que hay que recalcar y
  resaltar)}

\section{Basic properties of the NFW density profile}
\label{sec:basics}

Let us review first the basic properties of the NFW density profile.
This shall help us to define our notation and review the important
assumptions of the two different methods commonly used to measure the
concentration to finally present the new method.

\subsection{Density profile}

The NFW density profile can be written as

\begin{equation}
\rho(r) = \frac{\rho_c\delta_c}{r/r_s(1+r/r_s)^2},
\label{eq:definition}
\end{equation}
%
where $\rho_c\equiv 3H^2/8\pi G$ is the Universe critical density, $H$
is the Hubble constant, $G$ and the universal gravitational constant,
$\delta_c$ is the halo dimensionless characteristic density and $r_s$
is the scale radius. This radius marks {\bf the point where the
  logarithmic slope of the density profile is equal to -2} marking the
transition between the power law scaling $\rho\propto r^{-1}$ for
$r<r_s$ and $\rho\propto r^{-3}$ for $r>r_s$.

We define the virial radius of a halo, $r_v$, as the boundary of the
spherical volume that encloses a density of $\Delta_h$ times the mean
density of the Universe.  The corresponding mass $M_{v}$, the virial
mass, can be written as $M_{v} = \frac{4\pi}{3}\bar{\rho}\Delta_h
r_v^3$.  From these virial quantities we define new dimensionless
variables for the radius and mass $x\equiv r/r_v$ and $m\equiv
M(<r)/M_v$.

In this paper we use $\Delta_h=740$ roughly corresponding to 200 times
the critical density {\bf at redshift z=0}.


\subsection{Integrated mass profile}

From these definitions we can compute the total mass enclosed inside a
radius $r$:
\begin{equation}
M(<r) = 4\pi\rho_c\delta_c  r_s^3\left[\ln \left
  (\frac{r_s+r}{r_s}\right) - \frac{r}{r_s+r}\right],
\end{equation}
%
or in terms of the dimensionless mass and radius variables

\begin{equation}
m(<x) =
\frac{1}{A}\left[\ln\left(1+xc\right)-\left(\frac{xc}{xc+1}\right)\right],
\label{eq:profile}
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
A=\ln\left(1+c\right)-\left(\frac{c}{c+1}\right),
\end{equation}
%
and the parameter $c$ corresponds to the concentration $c\equiv r_v/r_s$.

From this normalization value and for later convenience we define the
following function
%
\begin{equation}
f(x) = \ln\left(1+x\right)-\left(\frac{x}{x+1}\right).
\label{eq:f_NFW}
\end{equation}
%
The most interesting feature of Eq. (\ref{eq:profile}) is that the
concentration is the only free parameter to describe the integrated
mass profile.
 
\subsection{Circular velocity profile}

It is also customary to express the mass of the halo in terms of the
circular velocity $V_{c}=\sqrt{GM(<r)/r}$.
From this we can define a new dimensionless circular velocity $v(<x)\equiv
V_{c}(<r)/V_{c}(<r_v)$, using the result in Eq. \ref{eq:profile}
to have:

\begin{equation}
v(<x)=\sqrt{\frac{1}{A}\left[\frac{\ln\left(1+xc\right)}{x}-\frac{c}{xc+1}\right]},
\end{equation}


This normalized profile always shows a maximum provided that the
concentration is larger than $c>2$.
It is possible to show that for the NFW profile the maximum is
provided by

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{max}(v(<x)) = \sqrt{\frac{c}{x_{\rm max}}\frac{f(x_{\rm
      max})}{f(c)}},
\label{eq:max_v}
\end{equation}
where $x_{\rm max}=2.163$ \citep{Klypin2014} and the function $f(x)$
was defined in Eq. (\ref{eq:f_NFW}).

\section{Methods to estimate the concentration from N-body simulations}
\label{sec:method}

\subsection{Estimates from the density and velocity profiles}
{\bf To date,} there are two standard methods to estimate
concentrations in dark matter halos extracted from N-body simulations.

The first method tries to directly estimate the density profile.  It
takes all the particles in the halo and bins them in the logarithm of
the radial coordinate from the halo center.  Then, it estimates the
density in each logarithmic bin counting the particles and dividing by
the corresponding shell volume.  At this point is is possible to make
a direct fit to the density as a function of the radial coordinate.
This method has been {\bf used broadly for more than two decades} to
study the mass-concentration-redshift relation of dark matter halos
using the Millennium Simulation Series.

{\it no veo la necesidad de citar el ``trabajo mas'' reciente que usa
  el metodo, cuando ha sido usado durante mas de dos decadas!}
 
A second method uses the circular velocity profile.  It finds the
value of $x$ for which the normalized circular velocity $v(<x)$ shows
a maximum.  Using this value it solves numerically for the
corresponding value of the concentration using Eq. (\ref{eq:max_v}).
This method has been most recently used by \cite{Klypin2014} to study
the mass-concentration-redshift relation using the Multidark
Simulation Suite.


\subsection{Our proposal: estimate from the integrated mass profile}
Our method uses the integrated mass profile.  First we define the
center of the halo to be at the position of the particle with the
lowest gravitational potential.  Then we rank the particles by their
increasing radial distance from the center.  From this ranked list of
$i=1,N$ particles, the total mass at a radius $r_i$ is $M_i=i\times
m_p$, where $r_i$ is the position of the $i$-th particle and $m_p$ is
the mass of a single computational particle. In this process we
discard the particle at the center.

We divide the enclosed mass mass $M_i$ and the radii $r_i$ by their
virial values to obtain the dimensionless variables $m_i$ and $x_i$.
Once the mass profile is expressed in dimensionless variables the
concentration is the only free parameter. We use an Affine Invariant
Markov chain Monte Carlo implemented in the python module {\em emcee}
\citep{emcee} to sample the likelihood function distribution defined
by ${\cal L}(c)\propto \exp(-\chi^2(c)/2)$ where the $\chi^2(c)$ is
written as

\begin{equation}
\chi^2(c)= \sum_{i=1}^{N}[\log m_i - \log m(< x_i;c)]^2,
\end{equation}
%
where $m(<x_i;c)$ corresponds to the values in Eq.(\ref{eq:profile})
at $x=x_i$ for a given value of the concentration parameter $c$ and
the $i$ index sums over all the particles in the numerical profile.
From the $\chi^2$ distribution we find the optimal value of the
concentration and its associated uncertainty.

The construction of the numerical integrated mass profile has two
advantages with respect to the density and velocity methods, it does
not involve any binning (unlike the density methods ) and the sampling
method uses the information from all the particles in the halo (unlike
the velocity method).


\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We now present the results of applying the three methods above
mentione on two different halo samples.  The first sample is composed
by mock halos generated to have known concentration values in perfect
spherical symmetry following an NFW profile.  We use this sample to
check that we can recover the expected values but also gauge the
impact of the number of particles on the outcomes.  The second sample
comes from a publicly available N-body cosmological simulation.  From
this sample we quantify again the differences between all the methods
and also estimate the impact on the mass-concentration relationship.


\subsection{Mock halo sample}

The method we use to generate the mock halos is based on the
integrated mass profile.  We start by fixing the desired concentration
$c$ and total number of particles $N$ in the mock halo.  With these
values we define the mass element as $\delta m = 1/M$, corresponding
to the mass of each particle such that the total mass is one.  Then
for each particle, $i=1,\ldots,N$, we find the value of $r_i$ such
that the difference
%
\begin{equation}
m(<r_i;c) - i \cdot \delta m
\end{equation}
%
is zero using Ridders' method.

The value of $r_i$ is the radius of the $i$-th particle of the mock
halo.  Then we generate random polar and azimuthal angles $\theta$ and
$\phi$ for each particle to ensure spherical symmetry.  Finally these
three spherical coordinates are transformed into Cartesian coordinates
$(r,\theta,\phi) \rightarrow (x,y,z)$.

We generate in total $400$ mock halos split into four different groups
of $100$ halos each.  The four groups differ in the total number of
particles for their halos: $20$, $200$, $2000$ and $20000$.  Inside
each group the halos have random concentration values in the range
$1<c<20$ with a uniform distribution.  For all these halos {\bf ww?}
the concentration values using the density, velocity and mass methods
described in the previous section.  We quantify the difference between
the expected $c_{in}$ and obtained $c_{out}$ values by
%
\begin{equation}
D=(c_{in}-c_{out})/c_{in},
\label{eq:D}
\end{equation}
%
and
%
\begin{equation}
\avg{|D|}=\frac{1}{\left|{\cal{H}}\right|}\sum_{{\cal{H}}} |D|,
\end{equation}
%
where ${\cal{H}}$ corresponds to a set of mock halos, and
$\left|{\cal{H}}\right|$ is the number of haloes in ${\cal{H}}$. {\bf
  The larger the value of $\avg{|D|}$, the larger the discrepace of
  the concentrations obtained for that method}



\begin{figure*}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.70\textwidth]{error.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Average value of the relative error in the concentration
  estimate, $\avg{|D|}$, as a function of the particle number $N$ in
  the set of mock halos. Different symbols represent different
  methods. Our method provide the most accurate estimate at fixed
  particle number $N$.  {\it Con respecto a esta figura tengo una
    pregunta. Yo ajusté los perfiles con menos de 200 partulas? no
    recuerdo!}
    \label{fig:error}}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:error} shows the behaviour of $\avg{|D|}$ as a function of
halo particle number for the three different methods to estimate the
concentration.

At fixed particle numbers our method always shows the lowest
$\avg{|D|}$ values compared to the other two methods.  Its accuracy is
on the order of $10\%$ for $20$ particles in the halo, going down to
$0.01\%$ for halos with $20000$ particles.  The dependence of
$\avg{|D|}$ with the particle number $N$ goes approximately as
$\avg{|D|}\propto N^{-1/2}$, hinting that the accuracy of the method
is related to a decrease of Poisson noise.

The method based on the maximum of the circular velocity shows a
similar behaviour $\avg{|D|}\propto N^{-1/2}$.  Its accuracy is $2-5$
times less than in our method, on the order of $20\%$ for $20$
particle halos and $0.5\%$ for $20000$ particle halos. {\bf The method
  based on the direct density fit shows the lowest accuracy for a low
  particle number. As it is discussed in \citep{Munoz2011}, density
  binning for halos with particle numbers below $\sim200$ leads to a
  biased estimation of the mass density profile, and therefore to a
  biased estimation of the concentration parameter. This behaviour is
  evident in the large values of $\avg{|D|}$ for halos with number of
  particles below ~200 and an intermediate accuracy between the other
  two methods for a high particle number.}

\subsection{Halos from a cosmological simulation}

    method and the maximum velocity (left) and density (middle)
    methods. The line indicates the equal value between the two
    techniques. The right panel compares the results of the maximum
    velocity and density methods.
  \label{fig:mdv}}
\end{figure*}


{\bf The results presented in the previous section show that in an
  idealized setup (perfect spherical halos, pure NFW desity profiles,
  total isolation) our method of the mass profile performs better than
  the other two methods commonly used to measure concentrations in
  simulated dark matter haos. However, actual simulated dark matter
  halos are much more complex. They are not isolated, many of them
  experience mergers that take them out of the equilibrium. Halos may
  have also plenty of substructure, etc. All these effects disturb the
  mass density profile, taking it away from the ideal NFW profile we
  assume in this wok. In order to see the real performance of our new
  method use it to estimate the concentration parameter in dark matter
  halos obtained from a cosmological Nbody simulation and compare with
  the other two calsical methods.}

We use data from the MultiDark cosmological simulation that follows
the non-linear evolution of a dark matter density field sampled with
$2048^3$ particles over a cubic box of $1000$ \hMpc on a side.  The
data is publicly available through \url{http://www.cosmosim.org/}.
More details about the structure of the database and the simulation
can be found in \citep{2013AN....334..691R}.

We build a sample of all halos located in a cubic sub-volume of $100$
\hMpc on a side centered on the most massive halo in the simulation at
$z=0$ which corresponds to the \texttt{miniMDR1} tables in the
database.  From this sample we select all the halos at $z=0$ detected
with a Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm with masses in the interval
$10^{12}\leq M_{\rm FoF}/\hMsun \leq 10^{15}$.  The FoF algorithm used
with a linking length of $0.17$ times the {\bf mean} inter-particle
distance. This choice translates into an overdensity $\Delta_h\sim
400-700$ dependent on the halo concentration \citep{More2011}.
Finally, we select from the database all the particles that belong to
each FoF group.

From this set of particles we follow the procedure spelled out in
Section \ref{sec:method} with $\Delta_h=740$ (corresponding to $200$
times the critical density) to select an spherical region that we
redefine to be our halo.  This choice makes that our overdensities are
fully included inside the original FoF particle group.  On the
interest of providing a fair comparison against the density method we
only report results from overdensities with at least $200$ particles.

Figure \ref{fig:concentration} shows the results of the
mass-concentration relationship.

{\em Aqui hay algo importante que hay que entender antes de discutir
  esta gráfica , y es la razón por la cual el metodo del perfil de
  masa da valores de concentración tan bajos a baja masa y comparables
  a los de los otros dos métodos a alta masa. Es importante entender
  la razón de esto!.  Se me ocurren unas preguntas para tratar de
  entender. \\ 1) La grafica de c-M \ref{fig:concentration} usa todos
  los halos o solo los halos relajados? La inclusión de halos no
  relajados introduce in bias en la mediana en Cvir, así que vale la
  pena inclusive agregar una linea mas a la gráfica con los halos
  relajados y sin ellos. Para los otros dos métodos ya se sabe que
  hace la población de halos no relajados en la medida así que no creo
  necesario agregarlas para esos métodos. \\ Hay que explicar un poco
  mas la gráfica en el sentido de que se grafica y como se
  calculó. mean concentration?, Median concentrations? o mean in

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we presented a new method to estimate the concentration
of dark matter halos in N-body simulations.  We tested our method on
mock halo data to study the impact of total number of particles and
input concentration on the retrieved values.  We compared these
results against two other methods commonly used in the literature to
estimate concentrations.  Finally, we applied our method to halos
extracted from a cosmological N-body simulation to estimate the impact
of our method on the mass concentration relationship.


The first benchmark was performed on mock halos generated with known
concentration values for different particle numbers.  For all methods,
the accuracy in retrieveing the input concentration increases with the
number of particles as summarized in Figure \ref{fig:error}.  Our
method systematically shows smaller errors in the retrieved values
compared to the other two methods, going from $10\%$ for halos with
$20$ particles down to $0.01\%$ for halos with $2\times 10^4$
particles.  In our method the average error on the retrieved values
decreases with the number of particles as $\langle|D|\rangle\propto
N^{-1}$.  The error in density method initially behaves as
$\langle|D|\rangle\propto N^{-3/2}$ but at $N=2\times 10^3$ it
saturates to $0.1\%$.  For the velocity method the error behaves
closely to $\langle|D|\rangle\propto N^{-1/2}$.  We also gauged the
effect of different concentration parameters at fixed particle
numbers.  We found larger offsets for larger input concentrations.
The offset goes in the sense that the measured concentration tends to
be underestimated.  Nevertheless, the dominant effect on the
measurement is the particle number.

We used a N-body cosmological simulation to test the impact of our
method on the mass-concentration relationship.  Although the three
methods are in general agreement there are noticeable differences in
the mass concentration relationship.
