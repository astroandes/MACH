In this reply we include first a brief summary of astrophysical concepts
addressed to the statistician, which might help to clarify what we do in the paper.

Only then we address what we believe are the points raised by the statistician, 
which should also be forwarded to the science referee.

1. Basic astrophysical concepts.

Most astrophysicists believe that there is fluid permeating the whole Universe
called dark matter.
This fluid can be though as a continous density field.
Expensive Monte-Carlo computational simulations sample this density field
with point mass particles.

Astrophycisits have found that in the denseset regions this point mass distribution 
can be can be seen as a) spherical and b) as coming from a parent radial mass density 
distribution (RMDD) which can be characterized by a scalar parameter called the concentration, C. 
We are concerned with algorithms that estimate the concentration from
a set of a set of radial measurements R=(r_1,...,r_N) of the point mass particles.

2. Estimating biases using bootstrapping.

Starting from a set R with large N (N=10^6) coming directly from the expensive 
Monte-Carlo simulation we assume that it is a fair sample of the parent RMDD.
Each point r_i we use is an independent measure other r_j. 
That means that we do not ignore, add, or change r_i values depending on other r_j.
That could happen if, for instance, we removed randomly very clustered
r_i values around some r_j  (i.e. tried to smoothed out clumps).  
   
We bootstrap R, meaning that we select subsamples R* with N* points.
We use a Kolmogorov-Smirnov to compare each R* with the parent R. 
From this test we find a flat distribution of p-values indicating that we are doing a correct
subsampling of the parent set R.

Then, we estimate the concentration on R and use this as the correct estimated value C.
Using the same estimator we get the concentrations C* on the R* samples.
We define the bias as the average of the differences (C*-C). 

We use this to show that two commonly used methods to estimate the concentration have
a growing bias as the particle numbers decrease, while the new method
we present has a bias close to zero (Figure 1).

3. Covariance matrices in the new method to estimate the concentration.

The new method to get the concentration from a set R uses an approximated diagonal 
covariance matrix estimated from bootstrapping.
This is probably the point the statistician is worried about.
We are aware of the limitations of this method and mention that in the text.

We can safely change the approximated diagonal covariance matrix to different 
values and the estimated concentration values won't change as it only impacts the 
derived uncertainty from the Markov Chain, i.e., the minimum of the
chi^2 continues to be in the same place.

For instance, if we use N (the number of points in R) as the variance in the
chi^2 expression (Eq. 9) we find the same uncertainties as estimated
by the bootstraping computations described in the part 2. of this
reply (the continous lines in Fig 2).
